# My-Portfolio
As a new, up and coming developer, I want to create a porftolio that displays my experience and work to potential employers that ensures that I will be a good fit for any position I am being considere for. My portfolio will not only show my accomplishments but highlight who I am as a person to give a holistic view of my ability to contribute to a team, culture, and ability to perform.
